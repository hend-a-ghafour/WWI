# WWI First Steps
1. Creating an initial ERD that shows the data that needs to be gathered
2. Based on the ERD, I created a Schema
3. Studied the original WideWorldImporters Database and explored the data types of each entity
4. Created an initial query of the tables that needs to be created (Total of 23 Tables)
5. Inserted values into those tables.
